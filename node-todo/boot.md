Boot your development environment

`blimp up` {{execute}}

Blimp is:
* Booting up all your services.
* Syncing your code over.
* Setting up tunnels.

Once everything is booted (TODO: img), you can access your app.

Open https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/ to view your app.

Normally this would be localhost:8080, but that won't work in the sandbox.
