Blimp has all the commands that you need for a complete development workflow. There are commands for doing everyday tasks like _getting logs_, and also more complex tasks like _restarting containers_.

Run `blimp help`{{execute}} to check them out.

## Getting Logs

A common task is getting logs. To view the logs of the Node.js service we just
booted, open a new terminal and run `blimp logs web`{{execute}}.
