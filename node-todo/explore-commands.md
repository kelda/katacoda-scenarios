Blimp has all the commands that you need for a complete development workflow. There are commands for doing everyday tasks like _getting logs_, and also more complex tasks like _restarting containers_.

Run `blimp help` {{execute}} to check them out.

To get logs, just open a new terminal and run `blimp logs web` {{execute}}.
