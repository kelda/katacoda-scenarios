You now know how easy it is to use and configure Blimp!

Using Blimp is as simple as running `blimp up` (just like `docker-compose up`),
and diving into development.

There's no additional configuration -- if you already have a
`docker-compose.yml`, then you're ready to move your development environment
into the cloud.
