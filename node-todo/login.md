Wait for the initialization script to finish, which takes about a minute.

Once you can type into the terminal:

1. Run `blimp login`{{execute}}. This will connect your session with your Blimp
   account.
1. Open the link printed by `blimp login` in your browser.
1. Login (or create a new account) on the login page.

   Once you've logged in, the CLI will automatically fetch your credentials.

   You're now ready to boot the example app in your personal environment!
